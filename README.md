# NEXTJS ARCHITECTURE

Welcome to the NextJS Architecture repository. This project is designed to provide a robust and scalable architecture for NextJS applications. We are excited to announce that this repository is open for development and contributions are highly encouraged.

## Technologies Used

- **UI Schadon**: We are utilizing the Schadon UI framework for building responsive and modern user interfaces. Schadon UI offers a comprehensive set of components that streamline the development process and ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.

- **Redux**: State management in this project is handled using Redux. Redux provides a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, making it easier to manage and debug application state, especially in large-scale applications.

- **Biome**: For maintaining code quality, we are using Biome. Biome is a tool that unifies code formatting, linting, and other code quality checks, ensuring that our codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is employed for styling. Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs directly in their markup, leading to faster and more efficient development.
